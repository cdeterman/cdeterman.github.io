This blog simply contains various programming concepts and scripts.  I primarily use R, Python, and C++ but I have also developed a keen interest in OpenCL and (regretably) CUDA for GPGPU computing.

## About Me

I am a professional data scientist.  My interests include multivariate analysis, machine learning, and bioinformatics.  With respect to programming I am interested in high performance analytics of big datasets.  As such I am currently developing code to use GPUs for high-throughput analysis.
